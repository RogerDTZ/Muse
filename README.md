# Muse
　　This is a fine color scheme for the terminal, as well for the vim inside. 

　　To use Muse, just open the file [**Muse.txt**](https://github.com/RogerDTZ/Muse/blob/master/Muse.txt) to copy the color settings out, and then paste them into your terminal's option file, suchas "**.minttyrc**" for **msys.**	

　　Following is an example when using **terminal** and **vim** for coding. I have tried to displayed as many elements in this i mage, such as syntax highlighted, vim's hilighted search, fold function, brackets match, annotation, and the cursor's color.

　　I spent a lot of time, trying to modify those colors, in order to reach a comfortable layout.

　　If you are using  **vim** in the terminal, please set the color scheme to **default**  in order to get the better experience (because i edited the terminal color in the default scheme mode). But of course you can try other scheme, perhaps they would have a better composit effect with Muse.

　　Till now i haven't try other language's syntax highlighted yet but C++, so I am not sure that Muse will perfectly adapted other language such as python and C.

　　Finally, I hope you will enjoy coding when using Muse.**
